We want to hear how sharing scholarship more openly is making the world a better place. There are a few ways to do that!

<div class="row" markdown="1">
  <div class="col-6" markdown="1">

    ## 1. Share an existing story with us

    Please note, not all links will be posted and may take some time to appear on the site as we're only a small team.

    ## 2. Write a story

    Got a story you think the world needs to hear? We bet you do! Nothing is too small, or too specific, to show the impact open can have. If you want to share your story write up a short draft and send it over using the form.

    Or, contribute a pull request on Github, if you feel comfortable with that.
